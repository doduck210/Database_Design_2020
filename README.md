# Database_Design_2020
for Database Design Subject

The codes above is using my local tomcat-server. So I edited a little bit with to use docker tomcat and uploaded the image of it to docker hub.
You can download the mysql's, and tomcat-server's image from 
(doduck210/project_mysql_image) and 
(doduck210/project_tomcat_image) 
in docker hub, and run it to see my Movie Database Web Application.
